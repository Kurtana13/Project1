            <h1>Paradox Interactive</h1>
            <p>
                Paradox Interactive AB is a video game publisher based in Stockholm, Sweden. The company started out as the video game division of Target Games and then Paradox Entertainment (now Cabinet Entertainment) before being spun out into an independent company
                in 2004. Through a combination of founding new studios and purchasing independent developers, the company has grown to comprise nine first-party development studios, including their flagship Paradox Development Studio, and acts as publisher
                for games from other developers. Paradox is best known for releasing historically themed strategy video games, especially grand strategy games, and has published strategy games in different settings, as well as games of other genres such
                as role-playing video games and management simulators. They typically continue development of their games after initial release with the creation of downloadable content, and are also known for creating games that are easy to mod. Outside
                of video games, Paradox has created board games based on several of its titles, and have owned the rights to the tabletop role-playing game series World of Darkness since purchasing White Wolf Publishing in 2015. They hold an annual convention,
                PDXCon, which has been open to the public since 2017.
            </p>
            <h1>Grand strategy</h1>
            <p>
                Paradox Interactive has generally focused on publishing grand strategy games made by its subsidiary, Paradox Development Studio. Grand strategy games are played on a real-world map, marked by the use of standard real-time elements but with an ability
                to make any and all changes even while paused. The focus of each game is different, but generally a player must manage the economy, commerce, internal politics, diplomacy, technological development, and military forces of a nation. The
                games are usually nonlinear with no set victory condition. Examples of these grand strategy games in Paradox' catalogue include Stellaris, the Europa Universalis series, the Crusader Kings series, and the Hearts of Iron series.
            </p>
            <h1>Modding</h1>
            <p>
                Paradox tries to make games that are open and easy to edit (moddable), from tweaking a saved game to creating a new scenario. Modding can be accomplished with simple tools and basic knowledge of scripting. To assist modders to figure out how to edit the
                game on their own, the Paradox forums provide fan-compiled libraries of "how to" advice. Paradox worked with Microsoft to develop Paradox Mods, an open modding platform that allows the same user-created mods to work both on Microsoft Windows
                and Xbox One system, with initial testing being done through Surviving Mars starting in February 2019.
